DOM = Document Object Model

It is an Object{} that represents the page you see in browser.
DOM allows use to access its elements and also gives us an API to interact with it.
In DOM, every element is stored in an hierarchical tree-like structure.
Web browser constructs the DOM when it loads the HTML document.
JavaScript can access the DOM to dynamically change the element, structure, and style of a web page.

``` javascript
document.body.style.backgroundColor = "hsl(0, 0%, 15%)";

const webMessage = document.getElementById("welcomeMsg");

const username = "Sooryansh";

webMessage.textContent += username === "" ? "Guest" : username;

console.log(document);
console.dir(document);
```
